# Vercel Color Palette

This repository contains a `tailwind.config.ts` and a `globals.css` file that includes the dark mode version of the Vercel color palette. I didn't find any official source of these colors, so I decided to create this repository.

## Usage

Just copy and paste what you need from the `tailwind.config.ts` and `globals.css` files into your project and enjoy.

## More

If you want to make a website full Vercel style you will also need to install Geist UI and use some of the predefined rules the vercel team has created. To find out more about this, visit this [website](https://vercel.com/geist/introduction).
